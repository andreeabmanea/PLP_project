This is my project for Principles of Programming Languages class. My task was to implement a programming language (inspired by one that already exists - my choice was C++). We had to provide both syntax and semantics for it, using Coq Proof Assitant.
I implemented the following: 
- arithmetic and booleans expressions & operations on them;
- relational operators;
- ternary operator;
- assignments, sequences, if & if-else statements, loops (while, for);
- some string operations such as concatenation;
- break, switch case;
